Abstract In order to improve the efficiency of operation and maintenance personnel in the research and judgment of the massive SER data generated by the converter station protection and enhance the converter station protection capability, a method based on FP-Growth algorithm for intelligent Decision Analysis of Converter Station SER. A multi-dimensional model is established for SER when converter station fails using data cleaning and association rule mining methods, and FP-Growth algorithm is used for data mining and analysis to obtain SER fault credible group.</description>
